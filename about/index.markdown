title: About Me

Hi there. I'm Patrick Byrne. But I guess you knew that already.

I make web applications and tools to make that process a bit easier. You can
see [all sorts of things I've done](/projects/). I care about the
craft of creating software and how we can improve people's lives in small ways
with accessible, easy-to-use tools.

I live in the Twin Cities with my lovely wife. I'm originally from Iowa.  I
like to cook. I mainly use Macintosh computers, because I care about the
quality of my tools.

I've had a fairly varied career, winding through technical support, technical
writing and editing, and managing the web stores for a [major software
company](http://learningcompany.com/), then discovered my passion for designing
and creating software for [a wonderful local search
company](http://planetdiscover.com/) and later [its parent
company](http://gannett.com/). Now, I find myself working with [an amazing
team](http://tstmedia.com/) to make [online tools for youth sports
organizations](http://ngin.com/).

Additional boring details are available on [my resume](/assets/files/resume.pdf).
