markdown:
  Hi there. I'm Patrick Byrne. But I guess you knew that already.

  I make web applications and tools to make that process a bit easier. You can
  see [all sorts of things I've done](/projects/). I care about the
  craft of creating software and how we can improve people's lives in small ways
  with accessible, easy-to-use tools.

  I live in the Twin Cities with my lovely wife. I'm originally from Iowa.  I
  like to cook. I mainly use Macintosh computers, because I care about the
  quality of my tools.

  I've had a fairly varied career, winding through technical support, technical
  writing and editing, and managing the web stores for a [major software
  company](http://learningcompany.com/), then discovered my passion for designing
  and creating software for [a wonderful local search
  company](http://planetdiscover.com/) and later [its parent
  company](http://gannett.com/). I spent a few years with [an amazing
  team](http://sportngin.com/) making [online tools for youth sports
  organizations](http://ngin.com/). Now I'm working with [a tiny
  team](http://dribbble.com/about) building [a kick-ass social
  network](http://dribbble.com) for the world's best designers.

  Additional boring details are available on [my resume](/files/resume.pdf).
