### Why Did I Do This?

As mentioned in [my discussion of "NPM For Fun and Profit"][npm], that talk began with a Ruby focus. This is that version of the talk, which I had an opportunity to present at the March meeting of [Ruby Users of Minnesota][rum]

### What Did I Learn?

This is the first time I've given the same talk to two different audiences. I'm not sure exactly what the cause was (maybe the venue, maybe that I was more relaxed, maybe different temperaments of the audiences, maybe chance), but this time things went much more smoothly. My nerves mostly dropped away shortly after beginning. My jokes landed better, or at least there were laughs this time rather than silence, and I didn't rush through nearly as quickly. There was less Q&A afterward, but I wouldn't necessarily say that's a bad thing.

This gave me more confidence that I can actually speak well to a group of strangers. I've found that since then, I've been more excited to spend time thinking of new topics to discuss and with a larger range audiences. We'll have to see how that goes.
