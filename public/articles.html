        <p>So I picked up Killing Sacred Cows from the library, because it looked
          intriguing. The cover says “Overcoming the financial myths that are
          destroying your prosperity”. There are lots of hucksters separating
          good people from their coin in the name of “helping” them financially:
          day-trading software vendors, whole-life insurance salesmen, “financial
          counsellors” with no fiduciary responsibility.
