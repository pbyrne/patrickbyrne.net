excerpt: I was asked to train our designers on how to use Git. I focused first on explaining what version control is and does, then moved onto terminology, then the nuts and bolts of interacting with Git. It seemed to go well.

## Why Did I Make This?

I was asked to perform some training for our designers, introducing them to
Git. I've given this presentation a few more times to other non-technical
members of [the company][sportngin]. Unlike [Enhanced Ass-Kicking with
Git][ass-kicking], where I dealth with more advanced configuration and
tailoring Git to fit to you, I focused here on the theory behind version
control, the terminology used with Git, and the mechanical commands you use to
interact with it.

## What Did I Learn?

I learned that explaining version control systems to non-technical people is
challenging. I believe the training was successful, though, because the
questions I tend to get after this training aren't about how to work with Git.

I didn't learn much techincally, because this was simply re-implementing [the
presentation software][deck.js] I used in Enhanced Ass-Kicking. I felt the pain
of copying and pasting template code, but solving that (with something like
Jekyll) will have to wait.
