## Why Did I Make This?

I built [IsWhen.info](http://iswhen.info/) so I never have to scramble to
figure out when, for example, Thanksgiving occurs next. If anyone else gets any
good out of it, all the better.

This necessitated lots of digging around the internet for dates of irregular
events and holidays. I hope everything's accurate.

This information is also available through my [iPhone
app](http://example.com/).

## What Did I Learn?

This application has gone through several iterations, starting with a PHP
implementation and then followed by Ruby on Rails.

If memory serves, this is the first application I worked on outside of work
which I finished. This involved quite a bit of education on server setup and
maintenance, DNS setup, and the like. If I learned nothing else, is that a
career in Operations is not in my future.

I am confident that I actually finished this project **because** I created this
site to serve my own needs. You read about scratching your own itch, and I
learned that it helps keep you driven and focused on the problem at hand.

Also, this project taught me to start small. I could have created a complex CMS
backend for managing recurring events or added tons of bells and whistles.
Keeping the project simple is the other main reason that I completed it, I'm
sure.
