I've long been frustrated with the highly technical explanations I found online
of the [cron syntax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#crontab_syntax). (For
those unaware, Linux, and Mac OS X, and the like use `cron` to schedule
recurring tasks like reports or maintenance.) I knew roughly what I need to
know usually, but I’d often not be entirely clear when specifically my command
would run.

Enter [CronChecker.net](http://cronchecker.net/). Type in a `cron` statement, and it will tell you exactly,
in **plain English** when it will run (or tell you it’s invalid if that’s the
case). No fuss, no muss.
