<p>
Hi there.
I'm Patrick Byrne.
But I guess you knew that already.
</p>

<p>
I make web applications and tools to make that process a bit easier.
You can see <a href="/projects/">all sorts of things I've done</a>.
I care about the craft of creating software and how we can improve people's lives in small ways with accessible, easy-to-use tools.
</p>

<p>
I live in the Twin Cities with my lovely wife.
I'm originally from Iowa.
I like to cook.
I mainly use Macintosh computers, because I care about the quality of my tools.
</p>

<p>
I've had a fairly varied career, winding through technical support, technical writing and editing, and managing the web stores for a <a href="http://learningcompany.com/">major software company</a>, then discovered my passion for designing and creating software for <a href="http://planetdiscover.com/">a wonderful local search company</a> and later <a href="http://gannett.com/">its parent company</a>.
I spent a few years with <a href="http://www.sportngin.com/about">an amazing team</a> making <a href="http://www.sportngin.com/">online tools for youth sports organizations</a>.
Now I'm working with <a href="http://dribbble.com/about">a tiny team</a> building <a href="http://dribbble.com">a kick-ass social network</a> for the world's best designers.
</p>

Additional boring details are available on <a href="/files/resume.pdf">my resume</a>.
