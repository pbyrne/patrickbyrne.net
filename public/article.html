          Why "Killing Sacred Cows" Is A Stupid And Dangerous Book
        </h2>

      <p>So I picked up Killing Sacred Cows from the library, because it looked
        intriguing. The cover says “Overcoming the financial myths that are
        destroying your prosperity”. There are lots of hucksters separating
        good people from their coin in the name of “helping” them financially:
        day-trading software vendors, whole-life insurance salesmen, “financial
        counsellors” with no fiduciary responsibility.</p>

      <p>I thought maybe this book would take aim at those, or similar, false
        hopes. Then I opened the book.</p>

      <p>I saw my first red flag when reading the front flap. I was willing to
        look past the statement that “401(k)s and other qualified retirement
        plans are risky and destructive to most individuals”, because it was
        probably just strongly worded to get more readers and I don’t know for
        certain that it’s not true. No, the first red flag was that the author
        provides a program, described as “a proprietary educational process”,
        to help “qualified individuals” get safer investments.</p>

      <p>OK. So I’ve found the purpose of the book. This man is trying to sell
        consulting. My trust in his message was beginning to crumble. I’m not
        particularly interested in learning about how I need to pay him money
        to learn how to succeed, especially when well-diversified index funds
        are already a proven way to earn quality returns.</p>

      <p>I decided to soldier on anyway, just to see if there was anything
        worth gleaning from the book. It was a decidedly mixed bag.
        Essentially, every good point the book made was hidden behind straw men
        and false dichotomies.</p>

      <p>I almost returned the book after the first chapter. It discusses the
        differences between a scarcity mindset and an abundance mindset. Many
        people have a scarcity mindset, where they believe that everything they
        gain someone must have lost. Every dollar I earn must mean someone who
        would have earned it didn’t. This simply isn’t true, and I agree with
        the author. Human potential multiplies natural resources, and
        technology continues to accelerate that process. However, I wouldn’t
        have been as annoyed reading this chapter if he had tried to inspire
        the reader, rather than insult them (if they subscribed to the scarcity
        mindset) or their intelligence (if they were already on board).</p>

      <p>Things didn’t get much better as I continued reading. It features yet
        another false dichotomy: you can either “put all your money in a 401(k)
        and forget about it” because “retirement is going to cost you
        everything you can possibly save” <strong>OR</strong> you can “put it to productive
        use”. He leaves no middle ground of saving some for retirement while
        also doing productive things with the rest of your money. He then
        trashes net worth as a means of measuring your financial progress, and
        prefers cash flow as a measure. This completely ignoring the fact that
        high net worth actually leads to cash flow, as interest and dividends
        from your investments.</p>

      <p>Please allow me a brief digression. The national average household
        income is almost $50,000. You could achieve financial independence (not
        “retirement” where you decide to stop working, but financial
        independence, where you no longer rely on a paycheck or anyone else for
        your income, and money can stop being a factor in your decisions) when
        you can replace your income with interest and dividends equal of equal
        value. Conservatively, a net worth of $5,000,000 can do that
        indefinitely. Due to inflation, $50,000 of buying power today will take
        roughly $200,000 40 years from now. Assuming 8%-12% fluctuating returns
        from a well-diversified group of low-cost index funds, 4% of the value
        is “lost” to inflation, and you can then take another 4% as your
        $200,000 income. With the exception of the absolute worst-case scenario
        of a long-term bear market once you begin living off of this nest egg,
        this will last indefinitely. You can then continue working, because I
        assume that you’ve found work that you love, or you can volunteer, or
        travel the world, or donate to charities, or whatever you want with
        your money.</p>

      <p>Now, $5,000,000 sounds like a lot of money, and it is. But, it is not
        difficult to reach that net worth. Starting early is the key, as
        compound interest is your friend. At 10% growth (the average of the US
        stock market over its lifetime), money doubles every 7 years. Over the
        long haul, this reaps massive rewards. If the average person making
        $50,000 (from above) puts only 15% of their income ($7,500 a year or
        $625 a month) into a low-cost index fund averaging 10% growth, they’ll
        have that five million in less than 45 years. Remember that I’m using
        very conservative numbers. If inflation is less, or more money is put
        in, or the stock market does better, it works out even better.</p>

      <p>Anyway, back to the book. He starts spreading misinformation about why
        not to invest in the stock market. First, he says that 401(k)s are bad,
        so you should avoid them, without really explaining why, and then
        follows up with the fact that capital gains tax will dramatically
        impact your investments, so you shouldn’t invest in stocks. He
        completely skips over the fact that if you invest in 401(k)s or IRAs
        (both traditional and Roth), you don’t even pay capital gains tax. He
        also <strong>lies</strong> that stock growth is falsely reported. His example is that a
        year of 100% growth ($10 to $20) followed by 50% decline ($20 back to
        $10) would be reported as 25% average growth (in other words (100 – 50)
        / 2 = 25), when that simply isn’t the case. That would be reported as
        0% average growth, because that’s what it is.</p>

      <p>Chapter 3 I almost begin to agree with, but it’s hidden again behind a
        false dichotomy. You can either break your back working for whatever
        scraps someone will pay you, hoarding as much as you can, or you can
        find work that you like, providing you with joy and fulfillment. Again,
        he could have made this point in an inspiring way, rather than a
        disparaging way. Many people think that they have to work jobs they
        hate because it pays. This simply isn’t true. Most people vastly
        undervalue themselves, and don’t think they can get paid as well doing
        work they love. I submit, and the author clearly agrees, that this just
        isn’t the case. Follow your passion and find ways to get paid. Like to
        take pictures? Become a wedding and event photographer. Like to write?
        Get a job at the local paper, start a blog, write a book in the
        evenings while you work your day job. You just need to figure out what
        you want and work towards that.</p>

      <p>I’ll be honest, though, that I had trouble getting any further in the
        book. As I said before, every good point was hidden behind an insulting
        attitude, straw men, and false dichotomies. Even when I agreed with the
        kernel of truth that was buried under the bullshit, I was still
        frustrated and annoyed.</p>

      <p>OK, so that’s why it’s stupid. What makes the book dangerous? First,
        I’m concerned that people will take this man seriously and won’t save
        for their later years. We have this problem enough without this man.
        Something like fewer than 20% of people over age 60 have enough savings
        to pay for an emergency before their next pension or Social Security
        check comes in. This is frightening to me, especially as my parents get
        older.</p>

      <p>But worse, the author advocates using debt and leveraging to
        accelerate your cash flow, which he describes is how large businesses
        operate. I certainly advocate using a portion of your cash to invest in
        yourself, in training, in learning, in developing your skills, like a
        business. However, for anyone watching the financial news lately has
        learned, this is a double-edged sword. While leverage does accelerate
        gains when things are on the upswing, it also accelerates losses when
        things are on the downside. A business can absorb these losses or
        disappear. A person has no such opportunity. If they go broke doing
        this, they are simply broke, or bankrupt.</p>

      <p>In the end, the book still couldn’t beat the common-sense financial
        advice you can pick up anywhere sensible:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Do the work you love</li>
        <li>Spend less than you make</li>
        <li>Have a rainy day fund</li>
        <li>Invest the difference</li>
        <li>Entrepreneurship is risky, but very rewarding</li>
      </ul>
