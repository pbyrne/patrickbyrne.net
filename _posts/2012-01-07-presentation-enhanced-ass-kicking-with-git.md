## Why Did I Make This?

I gave this presentation at [my amazing job][tstmedia], ([apply
today!][careers]) for our monthly Developer Lunch. In it, I summarize how to
configure Git to:

* bypass some of its archaic syntax
* work more efficiently

## What Did I Learn?

This is the first presentation I've created outside of Keynote. Keynote is
great software for creating powerful presentations, but as a developer, I've
longed for the ability to create a presentation in versioned plain text. I also
wanted to post the slides to my website without degrading their quality.

With that in mind, I searched for an HTML-based presentation tool. After
reviewing several, I settled on [deck.js]. It had the best compromise between
simplicity and flexibility of the tools I reviewed. Also, it had several
choices of themes, which helps for non-designers such as myself.

Since the presentation is a static HTML site powered by JavaScript, I was able
to simply host the project with [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] by pushing the project
to [the Git repository][repo] I was already going to use.

I intentionally worked counter to the common wisdom of keeping the slides
minimal, to support the points that you're making verbally for two reasons:

* The meat of the presentation are code examples, and it's far more efficient
  to put these up on the screen than to read them aloud.
* I wanted this presentation to stand alone as a reference document for the
  developers that weren't present and future hires.
