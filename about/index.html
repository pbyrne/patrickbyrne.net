<p>
  Hi there. I'm Patrick Byrne. But I guess you knew that already.
</p>

<p>
  I make web applications and tools to make that process a bit easier. You can
  see <a href="/projects/">all sorts of things I've done</a>. I care about the
  craft of creating software and how we can improve people's lives in small
  ways with accessible, easy-to-use tools.
</p>

<p>
  I live in the Twin Cities with my lovely wife. I'm originally from Iowa.  I
  like to cook. I mainly use Macintosh computers, because I care about the
  quality of my tools.
</p>

<p>
  I've had a fairly varied carreer, winding through technical support,
  technical writing and editing, and managing the web stores for a <a
    href="http://learningcompany.com/">major software comapny</a>, then
  discovered my passion for designing and creating software for <a
    href="http://planetdiscover.com/">a wonderful local search company</a> and
  later <a href="http://gannett.com/">its parent company</a>. Now, I find
  myself working with <a href="http://tstmedia.com/">an amazing team</a> to
  make <a href="http://ngin.com/">online tools for youth sports
    organizations</a>.
</p>

  Additional boring details are available on <a href="/files/resume.pdf">my
    resume</a>.
