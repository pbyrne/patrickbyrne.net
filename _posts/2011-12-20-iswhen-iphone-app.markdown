## Why Did I Make This?

I built the IsWhen iPhone App for a couple reasons:

* to get under the hood of the iPhone and learn a new skill, and
* so I could quickly access the [IsWhen.info](http://iswhen.info/) content from
  my shiny new phone.

## What Did I Learn?

I learned quite a bit. The most significant being that I had never worked with
a compiled language before this project. Up until this point, I'd dabbled in
PHP and ASP, but most of my work was in Ruby. The constraints and changes in
behavior to using Objective-C were off-putting at first, but I can appreciate
why the language works as it does. Even with this appreciation, I have no love
for it, and long for handhelds to become powerful enough that some future
version of Ruby (or even, God forbid, Python).

Also, this was my first app which provided feedback directly to me through a
Contact Me button in the application. I expected to receive comments and
criticism through this button, but have been shocked that 100% of the feedback
has been asking for additional events and holidays to be added to the
application. Anyone who uses this application has these users to thank for well
over half of the events.

On the TODO list this year is to update the iPhone application for iOS 5, using
many of the convenience classes that have been added since iPhone OS 2.1, which
this application was originally built with.
