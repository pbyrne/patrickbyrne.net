I built [IsWhen.info](http://iswhen.info/) so I never have to scramble to
figure out when, for example, Thanksgiving occurs next. If anyone else gets any
good out of it, all the better.

Built in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), designed and implemented by
me. The underlying data is gathered from around the internet. I hope it's all
accurate.

This information is also available through my [iPhone
app](http://example.com/).
