## Why Did I Make This?

I've been a podcast subscriber since way back in the early days (remember [Odeo]?), and have kicked around a few ideas for actually *making* a podcast, but never pulled the trigger. Some Twitter conversations with your friend and mine, [Samuel Fine][samefine] lead us to want to make a podcast about TV, and after some experimentation, [Some Fine TV][somefinetv] was born.

There's never been a better time to be a fan of television. More great shows are produced now than ever before. Where and when and how you can watch those shows have never been more plentiful. It's a subject that I'm passionate about and have tons of opinions, so why not share them with the world? You can't possibly watch it all, so if we could help guide you to the best that's out there, we've helped you out.

## What is It?

In short, it's a podcast about amazing television. In our brainstorming, we conceived several types of episodes: we anticipated the bread and butter would be reviews of an entire season (or chunk of a season) of our favorite shows, but also wanted flexibility to do short weekly reviews of a particular show if it struck our fancy, and lastly grab-bag episodes where we talk about what we're watching at the moment and shows we're anticipating.

Our (semi-unreleased) pilot covered the first and third idea: an opening segment talking about what we were watching at the moment, followed by a lengthier conversation about the first season of Netflix's [Daredevil]. What we didn't anticipate, though, was the phenomenon that became [Mr Robot]. It premiered right as we started to get our show going and quickly became our obsession, reviewing each episode in turn. And rather than the 10-minute mini-episodes we expected them to be, the spiraled out to hour-long conversations about each episode, its technical and artistic accomplishment, and speculation about what would come next.

## What Did I Learn?

First and foremost: making a podcast is fucking *hard*. Sadly with both hosts having toddlers and other responsibilities, the podcast is on hiatus at the moment while we figure out a way to make it fit.

I learned how much fun it is to record a podcast. Our style was a common one for podcasts, a few friends hanging out and talking about a thing they enjoy.

More prosaically, I learned how to generate podcast RSS feeds.
